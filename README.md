## Anmoney - CRM

A responsive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform focused on client organization and daily productivity. This project highlights my ability to integrate third-party APIs, write type-safe code, and structure a scalable web application meant for real-world business use cases.

Technologies used:
- HTML5 & CSS3
- TypeScript (for type safety and better DX)
- Clerk (for robust Authentication)
- Claude Code

##
*PS: Managing sensitive client data is serious business, which is exactly why I integrated Clerk—to ensure the authentication flow is as secure, modern, and seamless as possible.*
